**Hydroflow: Pipeline Flow Simulation Tool**

Welcome to Hydroflow, a Streamlit-based web application designed to simulate and analyze the flow of fluids in pipelines, particularly for the oil and gas industry. With Hydroflow, you can explore different flow conditions, understand fluid behavior throughout the pipeline, and generate insightful visualizations.

**Features**

- Input fluid properties such as pressure, temperature, specific gravity, API gravity, gas-to-liquid ratio (GLR), and water cut (BSW).

- Configure pipeline sections with hydraulic diameter, roughness, length, inclination angle, and flow orientation.

- Define thermal profiles, including adiabatic or user-defined external temperatures.

- Choose flow models, such as the drift-flux method, for accurate simulations.

- Simulate the impact of pumps by specifying their location.

- Visualize key variables like pressure, temperature, density, and velocity along the pipeline.

**Launch the application in your browser.**
